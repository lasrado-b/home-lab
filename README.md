# 🧠 Home Lab: IT Networking & Security Simulation

This is a self-directed home lab built to simulate a small office IT environment. The goal is to strengthen real-world skills in networking, system administration, and cybersecurity using open-source tools and virtual machines. It complements my formal certifications and customer support experience as I transition into technical IT roles.
