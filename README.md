# Home Lab: IT Networking & Security Simulation

This is a self-directed home lab built to simulate a small office IT environment. The goal is to strengthen real-world skills in networking, system administration, and cybersecurity using open-source tools and virtual machines. It complements my formal certifications and customer support experience as I transition into technical IT roles.

## Project Goals

- Simulate a real-world small office IT infrastructure
- Implement firewall rules and VLAN segmentation with pfSense
- Practice system administration tasks across Linux and Windows
- Set up internal services (file sharing, web, DNS, logging)
- Test and harden systems through red-team/blue-team exercises

---

## Current Progress

- [x] Deployed pfSense with LAN/WAN configuration
- [x] Installed and configured Ubuntu Server with static IP
- [x] Created and configured Kali Linux for testing
- [x] Verified full network connectivity between VMs
- [ ] Enabled SSH access to Ubuntu Server
- [ ] Created basic pfSense firewall rules
- [ ] Documented network layout and rules

## ðŸ”’ Firewall Configuration

- Configured pfSense firewall rules to block unauthorized traffic.
- Blocked all traffic from Kali subnet (192.168.2.0/24) to the Ubuntu server (192.168.1.10).
- Verified the block by testing ICMP (ping) and confirmed 100% packet loss from Kali to Ubuntu.
- Kali retains network access to other devices (e.g., pfSense, Windows VM, external internet) confirming proper segmentation.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- VirtualBox
- pfSense CE
- Ubuntu Server 22.04
- Windows 10
- Kali Linux
- OpenSSH
- Netplan (static IP)
- ICMP/DNS/NAT troubleshooting
- Markdown (for documentation)
